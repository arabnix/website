Many people were disappointed with other, overly structured; training that gave a little bit of everything over 2-5 days. The attendees of these classes felt that much of the time was wasted on material they wouldn\u2019t use and the volume of information was too hard to retain.<\/p>\n<p>ArabNIX\u2019s Customized Linux Training starts with conversations concerning general topics and specific issues that need to be covered. A final course list is presented and approved before the material is developed to make sure it meets everyone\u2019s expectations. ArabNIX\u2019s staff then researches the class topics and creates the course work. The classes are normally taught at the customer\u2019s location to reduce the time staff members are away from their daily tasks\/projects and travel expenses; but an outside training facility can be set up for an extra charge.<\/p>\n<p>Linux offers many companies the stability and flexibility they need for their changing networks. ArabNIX\u2019s Customized Linux Training provides organizations with the quickest and most cost effective way to take advantage of Linux.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Our Training Plan is offered:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u00bb Onsite Training.<br \/>\n\u00bb Online Training.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> All of our Advanced Security Solutions is excluded from our Training Plans.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Instructors Qualifications<\/strong><br \/>\nWe are proud of our amazing team of certified &amp; qualified instructors ready to help you to meet the most demanding challenges you face, our team of trusted advisors will work with you to meet and exceed your expectations.
